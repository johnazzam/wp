          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>I like to think i have great programming skills that match a 5 year old. I have basic knowledge in Java, python and consider myself a script kiddie when it comes to html and css design.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>Personally, I see myself in the future as a malware analyst. However, I need to learn valuable skills like web programming to be able to understand it all.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div> It is the stepping stone and foundation for what i would like to be a career in cyber security. </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I would like to learn web programming. Like Javascript, PHP, how servers work and how they request data and process things from websites.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>Reddit is probably my most used website. Other than reddit just Google and not really much else.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I have about a million hobbies and interests. However, I wont bore you with them all. Recently, i have been focusing some time and effort in 3D printing and fishing. Two opposite ends of the spectrum, I know. Anything, where i can learn is my hoby. I always want to be the best,</div>
