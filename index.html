          <div>Srikanth Thudumu (An extremely nice person [He has already helped me heaps!])</div>

          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>I like to think i have great programming skills that match a 5 year old. I have basic knowledge in Java, python and consider myself a script kiddie when it comes to html and css design.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>Personally, I see myself in the future as a malware analyst. However, I need to learn valuable skills like web programming to be able to understand it all.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div> It is the stepping stone and foundation for what I would like to be a career in cyber security. To get to where I want to be, it will take time and a lot of hard work and dedication. This course I believe will teach me the basic principles to enter into the workforce with the knowledge I need. </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I would like to learn web programming. Like Javascript, PHP, how servers work and how they request data and process things from websites. I have already learnt so much, like the post and get requests when submitting forms. I have never really look at the url. I think it will be interesting to watch urls when i submit forms to see if they sanitise their inputs with a post request.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>Reddit is probably my most used website. Second to Reddit, it would definitly have to be thingiverse and then anaconda. You'll understand why in the next answer i provide.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I have about a million hobbies and interests. However, I wont bore you with them all. Recently, I have been focusing some time and effort in 3D printing and fishing. Two opposite ends of the spectrum, I know. Although, anything where I can learn I consider as my hoby. I always want to be the best at trying new things. I find fishing, difficult and a hoby where i will never stop learning. 3D printing i thought at first was just a bit of fun as i got my printer as a present for my birthday. Since then i have started 3D printing as a side hustle by selling custom prints for people.</div>
