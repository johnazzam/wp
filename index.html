          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>I like to think i have great programming skills that match a 5 year old. I have basic knowledge in Java, python and consider myself a script kiddie when it comes to html and css design.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>Personally, I see myself in the future as a malware analyst. However, I need to learn valuable skills like web programming to be able to understand it all.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div> It is the stepping stone and foundation for what I would like to be a career in cyber security. To get to where I want to be, it will take time and a lot of hard work and dedication. This course I believe will teach me the basic principles to enter into the workforce with the knowledge I need. </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I would like to learn web programming. Like Javascript, PHP, how servers work and how they request data and process things from websites. I have already learnt so much, like the post and get requests when submitting forms. I have never really look at the url. I think it will be interesting to watch urls when i submit forms to see if they sanitise their inputs with a post request.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>Reddit is probably my most used website. Second to Reddit, it would definitly have to be thingiverse and then anaconda. You'll understand why in the next answer i provide.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I have about a million hobbies and interests. However, I wont bore you with them all. Recently, I have been focusing some time and effort in 3D printing and fishing. Two opposite ends of the spectrum, I know. Although, anything where I can learn I consider as my hoby. I always want to be the best at trying new things. I find fishing, difficult and a hoby where i will never stop learning. 3D printing i thought at first was just a bit of fun as i got my printer as a present for my birthday. Since then i have started 3D printing as a side hustle by selling custom prints for people.</div>
		  <div>Assignment 1 analysis of website.</div>
		  <div>Dear client, 
<br><br>
Please find our analysis of your website below. 
<br><br>
What is currently being done well?
The content of this website is amazing and well documented and referenced. It is especially important that we remember our soldiers who fought for our country. The website does also have a simple approach to it, leaving it less cluttered which is also a great attractant to the website as it is visually simple. The search function works exceptionally well also. 
<br>
 <br>
Items needing development<br>
-	As it currently stands, the HTML code is not HTML5 compliant. What this means essentially is that the website will be difficult to be listed on googles first page. Whilst the website is utilising HTML 4, Googleâ€™s indexing algorithm will not prioritise the website to be listed. This means that it will the page could be listed on the second or third google page.<br>
-	The content layout is lacking in terms of the spread out of the content. How engaging it is with images and text out of line some sections of the website. Including the text is centred left and not padded into the centre.<br>
-	The content layout needs to be more engaging for a positive user interaction. Creating a design that engages the audience will lead to a more positive impressions and increase site views.<br>
-	The visual appearance of the website is not 100% aesthetic to the end user.<br> 
-	The colour palette used does not contrast as well as it could, nor does the website give justice to the content.<br>
-	The websites logo also has the wrong colour profile as it does not match the websites background and does not contrast well will the black text logo.<br>
-	The CSS used within the website is also outdated. This can cause issues as it will create compatibility issues with different browsers as technology moves on outdated utilisation of CSS will no longer work and create a poor experience for the end user.<br>
